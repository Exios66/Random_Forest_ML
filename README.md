# 📖 Overview

**Random_Forest_ML** is a hybrid educational + coding project that combines:

- A **Python Random Forest implementation**
- A **static documentation website** built with Quarto (`docs/`)
- Visual guides and explanations for students & ML practitioners

Its goal is to help users understand *how Random Forests work internally* rather than treating them as a black box.

---

# ✨ Features

- ✅ Custom Random Forest algorithm (classification / extendable)  
- ✅ Fully static educational website (`docs/`)  
- ✅ Clean repository structure for reproducibility  
- ✅ Visual explanations of decision trees and forest aggregation  
- ✅ MIT-licensed open source  
- ✅ Beginner-friendly and extendable for research or teaching

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python (version X — *specify your tested version*)  
- `pip` or `conda` for dependency management  
- (Optional) Quarto / R (only if you need to build docs)  

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Exios66/Random_Forest_ML.git
   cd Random_Forest_ML
    ```
2. (Optional) Set up a virtual environment:
    ```Python
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3.	Install Python dependencies:

    ```Python
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
